Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.You are designing a high-performing landing page for https://freedomteamtrading.kinsta.cloud/.  
The copy MUST remain word-for-word the same as on the current site. Do not edit or rewrite any text.  
Your task is to redesign the layout and styling to improve conversions, readability, and overall aesthetics.  

### Design Requirements:
- **Color Palette:** Keep the dark blue (#0A1A2F or close) and dark green (#0F3D2E or close). REMOVE the very light green/yellow currently used.  
- **Style:** Modern, sleek, minimalistic, and professional. Balanced use of whitespace.  
- **Tone:** Confident and trustworthy, with a financial/professional edge.  

### Layout Recommendations:
1. **Hero Section**
   - Full-width dark green or dark blue gradient background.  
   - Headline in white text, bold, centered or left-aligned.  
   - Subheadline directly below in lighter gray or off-white for readability.  
   - Single prominent CTA button (“Book Your Free 1-on-1” from current copy) in dark green with white text. Hover effect for interactivity.  

2. **Trust Metrics Section**
   - Present the numbers/metrics (e.g., “1,500+ Students,” “High Success Rate,” “Millions in Profits”) in a horizontal row or 3-column grid.  
   - Use consistent modern iconography. Icons should be styled in dark green/blue line art or filled with brand colors.  
   - Background should contrast the hero (if hero is green, make this section dark blue).  

3. **Optional Social Proof Section**
   - If available, space for testimonials or a credibility badge/logos row.  
   - Place immediately below the metrics section.  

4. **Whitespace & Structure**
   - Ample spacing between sections to guide the eye downward.  
   - Keep layout distraction-free, minimizing navigation links. Focus should be on the CTA.  

5. **Typography**
   - Sans-serif, modern fonts (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or equivalent).  
   - Large headline sizes for hierarchy, smaller but readable body text.  
   - All text must remain as-is, only styling can change.  

6. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure WCAG contrast compliance (white/light gray text on dark blue/green backgrounds).  
   - Mobile-first, responsive design with centered CTA button on smaller screens.  

7. **Performance**
   - Fast loading: compressed assets, clean CSS, avoid heavy animations.  
   - Subtle hover effects or micro-animations allowed for interactivity, but not distracting.  

### Deliverable
A fully responsive, conversion-focused landing page that uses the provided copy exactly as-is but applies the new design system above. Generate clean, semantic HTML and CSS (optionally Tailwind CSS) for implementation.
